============

The ROLE Widget Store - An implementation of a store based on drupal for OpenSocial and W3C widgets.

---

The ROLE widget store is a core component within the ROLE infrastructure and is used as repository for tools and bundles. It targets developers who add their tools to the repository as well as users who are using these tools in their learning environments.
The base of the store are tools which are in comparison to other widget stores all related to learning activities. Currently, W3C and OpenSocial Widgets can be added to the repository via upload or reference respective their specification. Beside the information which is already available in the tool itself a publisher is able to enrich the tools with additional metadata and categorise them.
The categorisation system relies on different levels. First tool categories, based on the PPIM model, are selected to supporting different learning phases and can be used for recommendations to complement a PLE. Second an ontology describing the tool functionalities is introduced. Further learning domains can be added to tools by querying dbpedia and describing the domain of a tool.
To exchange best practices users can create bundles of tools which are creating a benefit if used together. Learning resources can be added to these bundles and also enriched metadata and a categorization of learning domains. Published bundles are added in the store catalogue.
For adding widgets in the preferred system of the user several possibilities are supported. Besides referencing the tools also a push mechanism as well as a SPARQL endpoint is available. So the store is currently connected to iGoogle, Graaspand the ROLE Platform. Tools like the pedagogical recommender and the ROLE Requirement Bazaar are also integrated in the store and offer additional features for the user.

The ROLE Project, supported by the European Commission under the 7th Framework Programme, aims to build a framework that allows a learner to construct and maintain her own Personal Learning Environment (PLE). ROLE offers adaptivity and personalization in terms of content and navigation and the entire learning environment and its functionalities. The ROLE infrastructure will empower the learner for true lifelong learning across institutional boundaries. This Wiki is mainly dedicated to Open Source developers with the intention to use or extend software components created in the context of ROLE.
